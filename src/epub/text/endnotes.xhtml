					<p>In the French edition of Proudhon’s works, the above sketch of his life is prefixed to the first volume of his correspondence, but the translator prefers to insert it here as the best method of introducing the author to the American public. He would, however, caution readers against accepting the biographer’s interpretation of the author’s views as in any sense authoritative; advising them, rather, to await the publication of the remainder of Proudhon’s writings, that they may form an opinion for themselves.—<i>Translator</i> <a href="foreword.xhtml#noteref-1" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>M. Vivien, Minister of Justice, before commencing proceedings against the “Memoir upon Property,” asked the opinion of M. Blanqui; and it was on the strength of the observations of this honorable academician that he spared a book which had already excited the indignation of the magistrates. M. Vivien is not the only official to whom I have been indebted, since my first publication, for assistance and protection; but such generosity in the political arena is so rare that one may acknowledge it graciously and freely. I have always thought, for my part, that bad institutions made bad magistrates; just as the cowardice and hypocrisy of certain bodies results solely from the spirit which governs them. Why, for instance, in spite of the virtues and talents for which they are so noted, are the academies generally centres of intellectual repression, stupidity, and base intrigue? That question ought to be proposed by an academy: there would be no lack of competitors. <a href="preface.xhtml#noteref-5" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>Religion, laws, marriage, were the privileges of freemen, and, in the beginning, of nobles only. <i>Dii majorum gentium</i>—gods of the patrician families; <i>jus gentium</i>—right of nations; that is, of families or nobles. The slave and the plebeian had no families; their children were treated as the offspring of animals. <i>Beasts</i> they were born, <i>beasts</i> they must live. <a href="chapter-1-1.xhtml#noteref-7" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>If the chief of the executive power is responsible, so must the deputies be also. It is astonishing that this idea has never occurred to any one; it might be made the subject of an interesting essay. But I declare that I would not, for all the world, maintain it; the people are yet much too logical for me to furnish them with arguments. <a href="chapter-1-1.xhtml#noteref-8" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>See De Tocqueville, “Democracy in the United States;” and Michel Chevalier, “Letters on North America.” Plutarch tells us, “Life of Pericles,” that in Athens honest people were obliged to conceal themselves while studying, fearing they would be regarded as aspirants for office. <a href="chapter-1-1.xhtml#noteref-9" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>“Sovereignty,” according to Toullier, “is human omnipotence.” A materialistic definition: if sovereignty is any thing, it is a <i>right</i> not a <i>force</i> or a <i>faculty</i>. And what is human omnipotence? <a href="chapter-1-1.xhtml#noteref-10" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>
